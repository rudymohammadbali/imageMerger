# Image Merger
Image Merger allows you to merge multiple images into one. Itâ€™s perfect for creating collages, photo grids, or combining images in creative ways.


## Usage
You can use Image Merger from the command line by providing the paths to the images as arguments:

```
python main.py image1.png image2.png image3.png image4.png
```

This will create a new image named merged.png in the current directory, which is a grid of the input images.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pillow library
